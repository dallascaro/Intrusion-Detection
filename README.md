# Intrusion-Detection
This project simulated a cyber security attack and used an Intrusion detection software to alert the user of the attack.
This project used two Linux Distributions Oracle Box virtual machines that ran both Kali Linux and Ubuntu.
The main objective of this project was to simulate an attack and defense application using Metasploit to create the attack, and SNORT to provide the detection.

This project attempted to create many attacks in metasploit to harm a Skype application, an Apache Web server, and many other services.
The main objetcive of this project was to bring down or harm the application using a variety of attacks.
Metasploit would create a DOS attack targeting the Ubuntu machines application and ports the applications were using. 
Once the attafck would commense the next objective would to see if stealing users data or application data could be possible.

This project wasn't able to be flushed out as much as id like and only looked into the set up and basic attack vectors and intrustion detection of those attacks.
SNORT was configred for each attempted attack and was able to detect the attacks on the application.

Future ideas and applications for this would to be to create more unique attack vectors, as well as set up different types of applications to attack in order to test out the secrity protocols for each.
